_February 27, 2024_

Organization:
* SDX-ch9: The code files for the _SDX Ch. 8_ activity (as downloaded directly from the book website, unmodified) 

## Team Members for Part 1
Fabian, Molly

## Team Roles for Part 1
Who will start out as
* DRIVER: Fabian
* NAVIGATOR: Molly

You will switch halfway through the _SDX Ch. 9_ activity.

## Part 1 Documentation

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from SDX chapter 8?
What protocols do objects use and their implementation.

* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
How do we actually use mock objects? How does the example relate to them?
What are context managers?

Fill in the following table with your definitions and examples for the main concepts of this chapter --- mock objects, context managers, decorators, iterators.

| Concept | Brief Definition | When to use (generally) | Potential uses in audio archive project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **mock objects** | a temporary object with a fixed value  | early implementation and testing | testing the implementation of a function |
| **context managers** | ensures set up and teardown always executes | whenever we want to use mock object | testing with mock objects |
| **decorators** | encapsulation of a function | modify how the function behaves | implementing a cache |
| **iterators** | allows objects to comply with loops | when we want to use for loops | iterate through a list of sounds |


Write a short summary of what you did (which exercises) below.
