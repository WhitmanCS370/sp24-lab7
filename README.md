# sp24-lab7
Materials for week 7 lab in CS-370, which includes Ch. 8 "Functions & Closures" adapted from [Software Design by Example](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/) by Greg Wilson.

_February 27, 2024_

Organization:
* SDX-ch9: The code files for the _SDX Ch. 8_ activity (as downloaded directly from the book website, unmodified) 

## Team Members for Part 1
Jack Allard
Coden Stark

## Team Roles for Part 1
Who will start out as
* DRIVER: Jack
* NAVIGATOR: Coden

You will switch halfway through the _SDX Ch. 9_ activity.

## Part 1 Documentation

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from SDX chapter 8?
This chapter was really just a collection of advanced features in python. Protocols refer to ways that code can directly interact with the python interpreter.
  
* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
As mentioned, this chapter did not seem to really have a unifying theme. This made it a bit confusing to wrap our heads around.

Fill in the following table with your definitions and examples for the main concepts of this chapter --- mock objects, context managers, decorators, iterators.

| Concept | Brief Definition | When to use (generally) | Potential uses in audio archive project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **mock objects** | A simple simulated object that mimics the program running | Mostly used for testing | We think mock objects will be useful for testing our audio archive project |
| **context managers** | Allow a block of code to exist within a different context | For switching over to a mock object | Will be useful for testing |
| **decorators** | Allow you to wrap one function with another | Whenever you need multiple inheritance functionality in python | We aren't quite sure when we would need to use this one |
| **iterators** | A way of iterating through custom objects, allowing you to define specific iteration behaviors | When you want to iterate | Looping through a set of sounds in a directory|


Write a short summary of what you did (which exercises) below.
