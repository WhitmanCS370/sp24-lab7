* NAVIGATOR: Samuel Boerner

You will switch halfway through the _SDX Ch. 9_ activity.

## Part 1 Documentation

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from SDX chapter 8?

Mock object, context managers, iterator and wrappers
* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
How context managers and mock objects are used in practice?

Fill in the following table with your definitions and examples for the main concepts of this chapter --- mock objects, context managers, decorators, iterators.

| Concept | Brief Definition | When to use (generally) | Potential uses in audio archive project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **mock objects** | Temporary functions return values | Testing of functions requiring other functions | Parts of audio player require a few other functions |
| **context managers** | automatic operations before and after a block of code | Keep track of original test conditions for later restoration | General code testing |
| **decorators** | Modifiers for functions | Optional behaviors for functions | Define whether play audio forward or backward |
| **iterators** | for loop, etc. | When you need to iterate through a list | Listing whole library |


Write a short summary of what you did (which exercises) below.
